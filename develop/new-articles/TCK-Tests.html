<h1>Summary of TCK Tests related to Specification Assertions</h1>
<hr/><p>[<a name="NT"></a>NT] Not Testable</p><p>Unable to define a TCK test to verify the assertion in a manner that is implementation independent.

A nonFaces view target is recognized if the request contains the parameter <code>_jsfBridgeNonFacesView</code>. The value of this parameter is the <code>ContextPath</code> relative path to the nonFaces target. To handle this request the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> sets the response contentType, if not already set, using the preferred contentType expressed by the portlet container.

The default (<code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>) implementation returns the value of the <code>javax.portlet.faces.BridgeClassName</code> <code>PortletContext</code> initialization parameter, if it exists. If it doesn&rsquo;t exist, it calls <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> using the current thread&rsquo;s context class loader passing the resource path &ldquo;<code>META-INF/services/javax.portlet.faces.Bridge</code>&rdquo;.

Test: In action and in render get a the UIViewRoot and verify its a PortletNamingContainer. Call its getContainerClientId() and ensureit returns something with the portletnamespace id in it.</p><p>[<a name="6.92"></a>6.92] The namespace Id used in processing getContainerClientId() must be consistent for the lifetime of the view (across save and restore).

Test: In render following an action, test that this request parameter exists.</p><p>[<a name="6.98"></a>6.98] Finally, when its able to restore this parameter the bridge must also set the request attribute javax.portlet.faces.isPostback with a Boolean object whose value is Boolean.TRUE Test: In render following an action, test that this attribute is set with a value of true.</p><p>[<a name="6.99"></a>6.99] Note on encoding/xml escaping: because renderkits have their own pre/post processing to deal with situations calling for xml escaping in urls, the bridge must return an url that contains the identical xml escaping (or not) used in the url passed to encodeActionURL. I.e. if the incoming url is xml escaped the the returned url msut also be xml escaped, likewise if the incoming url isn&rsquo;t escaped the returned url must not be escaped. In the case xml escaping can&rsquo;t be determined from the incoming url, the bridge must assume the url is not xml escaped and return an unescaped url accordingly. Also, because there are situations where Faces components will further encode returned url strings by replacing <spaces> in the url with the &lsquo;+&rsquo; which not all portlet containers may be able to subsequently process, the bridge can (should) url encode the space character (%20) prior to returning the url regardless of any stipulation regarding base encoding. Test: Single test for containing encodeActionURL and encodeResourceURL tests. In render, call encodeActionURL 3 times: pased url (1) is xml escaped, (2) isn&rsquo;t xml escaped, (3) contains no indication &ndash; i.e. no query satring. Test that each url returned contains the corresponding encoding/escaping. Do same for encodeResourceUrl (where the url is to another Faces view).</p><p>[<a name="6.100"></a>6.100] EL resolution within the JSP Context.
