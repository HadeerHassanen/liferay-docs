<h1 id="summary-of-tck-tests-related-to-specification-assertions">Summary of TCK Tests related to Specification Assertions</h1>
<hr />
<p>[<a name="NT"></a>NT] Not Testable</p>
<p>Unable to define a TCK test to verify the assertion in a manner that is implementation independent. I.e. the test won't work in every portlet container/app server environment. Note, in some circumstances the test is provided so it can be used to verify behavior/compliance in environments that do provide the necessary support.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3-tests">Chapter 3 Tests</h2>
<p>[<a name="3.1"></a>3.1] For this specification, the returned name must be &quot;Portlet 1.0 Bridge for JavaServer Faces 1.2&quot;</p>
<p>Test: Write a portlet that gets Bridge API class and calls Class.getPackage to get the Specification Title and Version to compare with above statement.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.2"></a>3.2] The value <code>ALWAYS_DELEGATE</code> indicates the bridge should not render the view itself but rather always delegate the rendering.</p>
<p>Test: Run app with this config setting. Test by writing a ApplicationFactory to insert our own Application Impl that overrides setViewhandler which creates/installs the test ViewHandler before all others (on first call). In this text ViewHandlers render -- check to see what the renderpolicy is and set an appropriate msg indicator on the request (attribute)</p>
<p>[<a name="3.3"></a>3.3] The value <code>NEVER_DELEGATE</code> indicates the bridge should always render the view itself and never delegate.</p>
<p>Test: Run app with this config setting. Test by writing a ApplicationFactory to insert our own Application Impl that overrides setViewhandler which creates/installs the test ViewHandler before all others (on first call). In this text ViewHandlers render -- check to see what the renderpolicy is and set an appropriate msg indicator on the request (attribute)</p>
<p>[<a name="3.4"></a>3.4] <code>DEFAULT</code> indicates .... the bridge to first delegate the render and if and only if an Exception is thrown then render the view based on its own logic</p>
<p>Test: Run app with this config setting. Test by writing a ApplicationFactory to insert our own Application Impl that overrides setViewhandler which creates/installs the test ViewHandler before all others (on first call). In this text ViewHandlers render -- check to see what the renderpolicy is and set an appropriate msg indicator on the request (attribute)</p>
<p>[<a name="3.5"></a>3.5] If the configuration parameter is not present or has an invalid value the bridge renders using default behavior. I.e. as if <code>DEFAULT</code> is set</p>
<p>Test: Run app with this config setting. Test by writing a ApplicationFactory to insert our own Application Impl that overrides setViewhandler which creates/installs the test ViewHandler before all others (on first call). In this text ViewHandlers render -- check to see what the renderpolicy is and set an appropriate msg indicator on the request (attribute)</p>
<p>[<a name="3.6"></a>3.6] <code>LIFECYCLE_ID</code> is a <code>String</code> valued configuration parameter that describes the <code>ID</code> of the <code>Lifecycle</code> the bridge uses when executing Faces requests.</p>
<p>Test: Supply test FacesContextFactory. Create a new Lifecycle impl and register with its own ID. aka via faces-config.xml. Set init-param in web.xml to use. Verify in FacesContextFactory we are using this new Lifecycle -- test by getting the Lifecycle by ID and verifying that its the same instance as the one passed in.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.7"></a>3.7] If not set the bridge uses the ID for the default lifecycle (<code>LifecycleFactory.DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE</code>).</p>
<p>Test: Supply test FacesContextFactory. Don't configure any specific Lifecycle to be used. Verify in FacesContxtFactory that we are using the default one.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.8"></a>3.8] <code>excludedRequestAttributes</code> is an attribute whose value is a <code>List</code> of <code>String</code> objects each of which either defines a specific attribute name the bridge is to exclude from its managed request scope or defines a set of attributes the bridge is to exclude from its managed request scope.</p>
<p>Test: covered by 6.1.3.1: requestMapRequestScopeTest -- which tests that exclusion works.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.9"></a>3.9] Such wildcard usage indicates the bridge is to exclude all those attributes within the namespace identified by removing the &quot;*&quot;</p>
<p>Test: covered by 6.1.3.1: requestMapRequestScopeTest -- which tests that exclusion works.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.10"></a>3.10] <code>preserveActionParams</code> is a <code>Boolean</code> valued attribute that when <code>TRUE</code> indicates the bridge must maintain the action's request parameters for the duration of the bridge request scope.</p>
<p>Test: covered by 6.1.3.1: getRequestParameterPreserveParamsTest, getRequestParameterNamesPreserveParamsTest, getRequestParameterValuesMapPreserveParamsTest.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.11"></a>3.11] The exception to this is the <code>ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM</code> parameter which is always maintained in the bridge request scope regardless of this setting. (I.e. always preserve the VIEW_STATE_PARAM regardless of preserveActionParams setting).</p>
<p>Test: covered by 6.1.3.1:getRequestParameterMapCoreTest, getRequestParameterNamesCoreTest, getRequestParameterValuesMapCoreTest.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.12"></a>3.12] <code>defaultViewIdMap</code> is a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> valued attribute containing one entry per supported <code>PortletMode</code>. The <code>Map</code> key is the <code>String</code> name of the <code>PortletMode</code>. The Map value is the default Faces <code>viewId</code> for the mode.</p>
<p>Test: basically covered by any test. However add a test that supports a non-View mode (Edit) with a different viewId mapping. Then write a portlet that has an initial (non-JSF) render that adds a render link back to the portlet putting it in Edit mode. Verify our view is invoked.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.13"></a>3.13] Once destroy() has been called, no further requests can be processed through this bridge until a subsequent init() has occurred.</p>
<p>Test: subclass GFP, overriding the render behavior -- get the Bridge from GFP and then in a render call, init Bridge, destroy it, then call doFacesRequest(render) verify it fails as expected (i.e. throws UninitializedException). Do same but in processAction (i.e. destroy, followed by a doFacesRender), processEvent, and serveResource.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.14"></a>3.14] This call (destroy()) performs no action if the bridge is in an uninitialized state.</p>
<p>Test: Using test from <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.13">3.13</a> have it call destroy() a second time and verify that no exceptions are thrown.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.15"></a>3.15] <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewId</code>: The value of this attribute identifies the Faces <code>viewId</code> the bridge must use for this request (e.g. <code>/myFacesPage.jsp</code>). This is expected to be a valid Faces viewId though it may optionally contain a query string</p>
<p>Test: Write a portlet that has a default viewId of X.jsp but in its render sets the above attribute to y.jsp. Verify that y.jsp is activated. I.e. the X.jsp reports an error for the test while Y.jsp reports success.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.16"></a>3.16] <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewPath</code>: The value of this attribute contains the the Faces <code>viewId</code> the bridge must use for this request in <code>ContextPath</code> relative path form (e.g. <code>/faces/myFacesPage.jsp</code>). This value may optionally contain a query string.</p>
<p>Test: Same test as <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.15">3.15</a> but set a path relative viewId.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.17"></a>3.17] The <code>BridgeUninitializedException</code> is thrown if this method (doFacesRequest) is called while the bridge is in an uninitialized state</p>
<p>Test: covered by <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.13">3.13</a>.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.18"></a>3.18] The <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown (from doFacesRequest()) if either the passed request or response objects are <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Test: call both action and render forms of doFacesRequest passing null. (Get bridge from GFP to do this).</p>
<p>[<a name="3.19"></a>3.19] The <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown (from doFacesRequest()) if either the passed request or response objects are <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Test: call both action and render forms of doFacesRequest passing null. (Get bridge from GFP to do this).</p>
<p>[<a name="3.20"></a>3.20] <code>bridgeEventHandler</code> is a (instanceof) <code>BridgeEventHandler</code> valued attribute identifying the instance that is called to handle portlet events received by the bridge</p>
<p>Test: Covered by #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.56">5.56</a> -- Provide an eventHandler, trigger an event (in the test's action handler), have the eventHandler set a request attribute indicating its been called, have the test render check this bit.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.21"></a>3.21] <code>bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler</code> is a (instanceof) <code>BridgePublicRenderParameterHandler</code> valued attribute identifying the instance that is called to postprocess incoming public render parameter changes after the bridge has pushed these values into the mapped managed beans. This handler gives the portlet an opportunity to recompute and get into a new consistent state after such changes</p>
<p>Test: Covered by #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.71">5.71</a> -- Provide an PRPHandler, trigger a PRP change during an action (test's handler), have the PRPhandler set a request attribute indicating its been called, have the test render check this bit.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.22"></a>3.22] ... the renderkit id the bridge should encode as a request parameter in each request to ensure that Faces will use this Id when resolving the renderkit used by this portlet</p>
<p>Test: set the attribute (via configuration). In the test (render) have it test for existence of the request parameter that would indicate its use.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-tests">Chapter 4 Tests</h2>
<p>[<a name="4.1"></a>4.1] In addition the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> reads the following portlet initialization parameters and either sets the appropriate context attributes.</p>
<p>Test: In the JSF Test read the portlet context init params that correspond to the one the GFP should be setting for each of these and make sure they have the same value as the ones in portlet.xml</p>
<p>[<a name="4.2"></a>4.2] The <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> overrides the <code>init()</code> method and does the following:</p>
<p>Test: Subclass GFP and override init, call super(), override each of the methods its supposed to call -- verify they were called, verify appropriate context params set.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.3"></a>4.3] When not overridden by a subclass, the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> processes the request by first determining if the target of the request is a Faces or a nonFaces view. A nonFaces view target is recognized if the request contains the parameter <code>_jsfBridgeNonFacesView</code>. The value of this parameter is the <code>ContextPath</code> relative path to the nonFaces target. To handle this request the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> sets the response contentType, if not already set, using the preferred contentType expressed by the portlet container. It then uses a portlet <code>RequestDispatcher</code> to dispatch(include) the nonFaces target.</p>
<p>Test: Subclass GFP and overide render (to set the testname). Run test as a multirequest test. On action set the navigation (face-config.xml) to a viewId that is a nonFaces view (has the appropriate QS parameter.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.4"></a>4.4] If either the <code>_jsfBridgeViewId</code> parameter exists or both parameters exist and the <code>_jsfBridgeViewId</code> parameter value is non null, the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> must set the value of the request attribute <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewId</code> to the value of the <code>_jsfBridgeViewId parameter</code>.</p>
<p>Test: Set the navigation rule to navigate to a response page but have in its query string both of the above (also pointing to the success page). Verify in the test that the attribute is set.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.5"></a>4.5] If only the <code>_jsfBridgeViewPath</code> parameter exists and contains a non null value, the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> must set the value of the request attribute <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewPath</code> to the value of the <code>_jsfBridgeViewPath</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Test: Set the navigation rule to navigate to a response page but have in its query string only the viewPath (also pointing to the success page). Verify in the test that the attribute is set.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.6"></a>4.6] Otherwise the bridge is called without either of these attributes being set.</p>
<p>Test: Set the navigation rule to navigate to a response page. Verify in the test that the attributes aren't set.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.7"></a>4.7] The bridge calls this method during <code>init()</code>. <code>getBridgeClassName</code> returns the name of the class the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> uses to instantiate the bridge. The default (<code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>) implementation returns the value of the <code>javax.portlet.faces.BridgeClassName</code> <code>PortletContext</code> initialization parameter, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, it calls <code>getResourceAsStream()</code> using the current thread's context class loader passing the resource path &quot;<code>META-INF/services/javax.portlet.faces.Bridge</code>&quot;. It returns the first line of this stream excluding leading and trailing white space. If it can not resolve a class name, it throws a <code>PortletException</code>.</p>
<p>Test: override getBridgeClassName, have this method implement behavior as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.8"></a>4.8] The default (<code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>) implementation of <code>getDefaultViewIdMap()</code> reads each portlet initialization parameter prefixed named <code>javax.portlet.faces.defaultViewId.[mode]</code> where <em>mode</em> is the <code>String</code> form of a supported <code>PortletMode</code>. For each entry it adds a Map entry with mode as the key value and the initialization parameter value as the map value.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.9"></a>4.9] The default (<code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>) implementation for <code>getExcludedRequestAttributes()</code> returns a <code>List</code> constructed by parsing the comma delimited <code>String</code> value from the corresponding portlet initialization parameter, <code>javax.portlet.faces.excludedRequestAttributes</code>.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.10"></a>4.10] If this initialization parameter isn't present <code>null</code> is returned which causes the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code> to not set the corresponding <code>PortletContext</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned. -- in this case don't configure in portlet.xml so verify null.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.11"></a>4.11] The default (<code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>) implementation returns the <code>boolean</code> value corresponding to the <code>String</code> value represented in the portlet initialization parameter, <code>javax.portlet.faces.preserveActionParams</code>.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.12"></a>4.12] If this initialization parameter doesn't exist, <code>false</code> is returned.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.13"></a>4.13] It returns the portlet container's indication of the preferred content type for this response.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get preeferred content type -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.14"></a>4.14] It returns <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Test: override method -- test thatt super() returns null..</p>
<p>[<a name="4.15"></a>4.15] read the portlet initialization parameter <code>javax.portlet.faces.bridgeEventHandler</code> and return an instance of the class that corresponds to its value.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.16"></a>4.16] If this initialization parameter doesn't exist, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
<p>Test: override method, test that result is from super() is null.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.17"></a>4.17] read the portlet initialization parameter <code>javax.portlet.faces.bridgePublicRenderParameterHandler</code> and return an instance of the class that corresponds to its value.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.18"></a>4.18] If this initialization parameter doesn't exist, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
<p>Test: override method, test that result is from super() is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.19"></a>4.19] If it exists the value is interpreted as a <code>boolean</code> valued <code>String</code> (i.e. &quot;true&quot; is <code>true</code> while all other values are <code>false</code>).</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.20"></a>4.20] If this initialization parameter doesn't exist, <code>true</code> is returned.</p>
<p>Test: override method, test that result is from super() is <code>true</code></p>
<p>[<a name="4.21"></a>4.21] To support this the <code>GenericFacesPortlet</code>, via this method, returns a properly initialized and active bridge which a subclass can use to call one of the <code>doFacesRequest()</code> methods.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get value as specified -- then call doFacesRequest() and see that all works right.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.22"></a>4.22] return the value of the portlet initialization parameter <code>javax.portlet.faces.defaultRenderKitId</code>.</p>
<p>Test: override method, have this method get values as specified -- test that result is same as what super() returned.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.23"></a>4.23] If this initialization parameter doesn't exist, <code>null</code> is returned.</p>
<p>Test: override method, test that result is from super() is <code>null</code>.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5-tests">Chapter 5 Tests</h2>
<p>[<a name="5.1"></a>5.1] This additional associated data includes (state stored in bridge request scope):</p>
<p>Test: During action handling -- create all attributes/messages listed (including the excluded one's). On render verify what should be there is there and what shouldn't isn't. Test needs to render same view as runs in the action.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.2"></a>5.2] For each portlet action ignore any references to an existing request scope. I.e. portlet action requests always define the start of a new scope so never restore a preexisting one.</p>
<p>Test: During an action -- add a request attribute, in a second action test and see that its not there.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.3"></a>5.3] Upon completion of each portlet action preserve the state described above in a newly created bridge request scope if the action doesn't terminate because of a redirect.</p>
<p>Test: During an action -- add a request attribute, have the action's navigation rule indicate <redirect>, verify that during the render the attribute isn't there.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.4"></a>5.4] ... the navigational target of the action doesn't specify a portlet mode that differs from the current request.</p>
<p>Test: During an action -- add a request attribute, have the action's navigation encode a mode change, verify that during the render the atribute isn't there.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.5"></a>5.5] For each render request, the bridge identifies the corresponding bridge request scope that pertains to this request and if one exists it passes the state in this scope to the current (container) request scope.</p>
<p>Test: Covered by test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.1">5.1</a>.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.6"></a>5.6] For any action parameters that have been preserved, the parameter is restored if and only if there isn't an existing parameter of the same name in the incoming request.</p>
<p>Test: set preserveActionParams. Cause an action (with parameters), verify in render the parameters are there.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.7"></a>5.7] This corresponds to ensuring that <code>ViewHandler.createView()</code> is used to establish the viewroot vs. <code>ViewHandler.restoreView()</code>.</p>
<p>Test: Action followed by render, followed by render (redisplay but with a new Mode) -- verify that out test ViewHandler's createView is called not its restoreView.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.8"></a>5.8] Under normal conditions, a bridge request scope must be maintained at least until the next action request (a subsequent bridge request scope is established)</p>
<p>Test: Covered by <a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.1">5.1</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.9"></a>5.9] The bridge must not assume that all render requests following the establishment of a request scope (and prior to a subsequent action) are executed in the same bridge request scope.</p>
<p>Test: Same type of test as 5.7 except add an attribute in the action and verify its not there in the redisplay.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.10"></a>5.10a-e] exclude attributes based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an annotated bean</p></li>
<li><p>whose attribute name is listed as an excluded attribute using the <code>&lt;bridge:excluded-attributes&gt;</code> ... in faces-config.xml</p></li>
<li><p>whose attribute name is in the immediate namespace listed as a wildcarded excluded attribute using the <code>&lt;bridge:excluded-attributes&gt;</code> ... in faces-config.xml</p></li>
<li><p>whose attribute name appears in the <code>List</code> object of excluded attributes in the portlet context attribute <code>javax.portlet.faces.[portlet name].excludedRequestAttributes</code></p></li>
<li><p>whose attribute name appears in the immediate namespace listed as a wildcarded excluded attribute in the <code>List</code> object of excluded attributes in the portlet context attribute <code>javax.portlet.faces.[portlet name].excludedRequestAttributes</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Test: In action add request M request attributes -- some to test each of the 4 conditions above -- others to test the inverse -- that other attributes are retained.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.11"></a>5.11] The JSF 1.2 specification, section 6.1.5 requires that the various <code>FacesContext</code> methods that get <code>Messages</code> return those Messages in insertion order. The bridge must preserve this requirement while managing such Messages within the bridge request scope.</p>
<p>Test: Covered by <a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.1">5.1</a> -- the message portion of the test adds 2 messages to the UIView root and verifies they come back in the same order.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.12"></a>5.12] For each <code>doFacesRequest</code> invocation processing a Faces target, the bridge must acquire a <code>FacesContext</code> object. The bridge must acquire the <code>FacesContext</code> by calling the <code>FacesContextFactory</code>.</p>
<p>Test: 5.13 because it runs in the FacesContextFactory verifies this as well.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.13"></a>5.13] The <code>FacesContext</code> is acquired from the factory by passing the corresponding <code>PortletContext</code>, <code>PortletRequest</code>, <code>PortletResponse</code> objects and the <code>Lifecycle</code> ...</p>
<p>Test: In own FacesContextFactory -- verify that the correct types of objects are passed when acquiring the FacesContext.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.14"></a>5.14] Prior to acquiring the FacesContextFactory the bridge is required to set the following request attribute on the passed request object.</p>
<p>Test: In FacesContextFactory confirm that the attribute is set with the correct value.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.15"></a>5.15] If the request attribute named <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewId</code> is non null then use this value as the target <code>viewId</code></p>
<p>Test: Covered by test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.15">3.15</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.16"></a>5.16] If the request attribute named <code>javax.portlet.faces.viewPath</code> is non null then use this value to process the <code>ContextPath</code> relative path and extract the target <code>viewId</code></p>
<p>Test: Covered by test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.16">3.16</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.17"></a>5.17] If unable to extract a <code>viewId</code> from the path throw <code>javax.portlet.faces.BridgeInvalidViewPathException</code></p>
<p>Test: Added new arm to the Test portlet built for test 3.15/3.16. This portlet now also passes an invalid path via the attribute and verifies the exception is thrown.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.18"></a>5.18] If the bridge is processing for the target view in a render request which occurs in the same portlet mode following another render request in which a redirect occurred and an action request hasn't been processed in the meantime, use the target <code>viewId</code> from the prior redirect.</p>
<p>Test: Action navigates to render page which has a render redirect to a page that has a redisplay on it. Verify that the redisplay renders the redirected page.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.19"></a>5.19] Use this <code>viewId</code>, if and only if, the current portlet mode is the same as the portlet mode in which the <code>viewId</code> was encoded into the response</p>
<p>Test: Verify that the current ViewId is ignored when redisplay in a new mode: Use test that includes a redisplay link (to the currentView but with a new mode). Define in portlet.xml that the new mode (edit) default view is a different view. Verify that when the redisplay/new mode occurs you are on the default view page not the original view page.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.20"></a>5.20] If the bridge can't locate a default <code>viewId</code> for the current portlet mode or that default is <code>null</code>, throw <code>javax.portlet.faces.BridgeDefaultViewNotSpecifiedException</code></p>
<p>Test: Use a view that includes a redisplay link to the currentView but in a different mode. Don't define a default viewId for the new mode (but do define that the mode is supported). Write a portlet that catches the expected exceptionto verify the result.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.21"></a>5.21] When a query string is encountered the bridge must extract this information as part of its process of determining the <code>viewId</code> and expose the parameters in this query string as additional request parameters.</p>
<p>Test: 2 Tests: One where the default viewId contains the QS param and a second where the portlet sets the ViewId (on an attribute) with a QS param.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.22"></a>5.22] throw the <code>BridgeUninitializedException</code> if the bridge isn't currently initialized (<code>init()</code> has been called following either the bridge's construction or a prior <code>release()</code>) (action)</p>
<p>Test: Covered by the action destroy portion of test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#3.13">3.13</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.23"></a>5.23] set the <code>javax.portlet.faces.phase</code> request attribute to <code>Bridge.PortletPhase.ACTION_PHASE</code> prior to acquiring the <code>FacesContext</code></p>
<p>Test: Covered by test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.14">5.14</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.24"></a>5.24] recognize whether Faces considers the current request processing complete (redirect occurred) or not. If its not considered complete ... (set up action response correctly)</p>
<p>Test: Covered by any of our action based scope tests. Test <a href="TCK-Tests.html#5.1">5.1</a></p>
<p>[<a name="5.25"></a>5.25] release the <code>FacesContext</code> (at end of action)</p>
<p>Test: In test <code>FacesContext</code> set a request attribute on <code>release()</code> -- test in portlet that the attribute is there.</p>
<p>[<a name="5.26"></a>5.26] remove the <code>javax.portlet.faces.phase</code> request attribute (at end of action)</p>
<p>Test: In portlet that the attribute isn't there after action processing finishes.</p>

Also use this request to swap the names of the buttons so the GoLink is now the RunTest trigger. Have the GoLink represent a (redisplay) link back to this page. When it is invoked -- I.e. in this render phase, test that the request attribute still exists -- this means it was preserved in the scope at the end of the resource request.</p>

<p>Test: Same test as #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#6.91">6.91</a> except get the clientId in action, preserve it, then get the namespace in render as well as the clientId and ensure that both clientIds contain this namespace.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.93"></a>6.93] Because <code>getContainerClientId()</code> can be called during any portlet lifecycle phase (action or render).</p>
<p>Test: Covered by #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#6.91">6.91</a></p>
<p>[<a name="6.94"></a>6.94] The convenience class <code>javax.portlet.faces.PortletNamingContainerUIViewRoot</code> is provided to simplify adding portlet namespacing for Faces extensions (and for internal bridge usage).</p>
<p>Test: Create and instance of this class to ensure it exists.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.95"></a>6.95] The class is annotated with the <code>javax.portlet.faces.annotation.PortletNamingContainer</code> annotation.</p>
<p>Test: Ensure instance created in #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#6.94">6.94</a> is an instaceof PortletNamingContainer -- this is done as part of test #<a href="TCK-Tests.html#6.94">6.94</a></p>
<p>[<a name="6.96"></a>6.96] It implements <code>getContainerClientId()</code> to meet the above requirements.</p>
<p>Test: Call its getContainerClientId() and verify result. I.e. the id contains the portlet namespace id.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.97"></a>6.97] Furthermore it must restore this request parameter at the beginning of each <code>RENDER_PHASE</code> phase that corresponds to this bridge request scope such that a call to <code>ExternalContext.getRequestParameterMap().get(ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM</code>) returns the restored value.</p>
<p>Test: In render following an action, test that this request parameter exists.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.98"></a>6.98] Finally, when its able to restore this parameter the bridge must also set the request attribute <code>javax.portlet.faces.isPostback</code> with a <code>Boolean</code> object whose value is <code>Boolean.TRUE</code></p>
<p>Test: In render following an action, test that this attribute is set with a value of true.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.99"></a>6.99] Note on encoding/xml escaping: because renderkits have their own pre/post processing to deal with situations calling for xml escaping in urls, the bridge must return an url that contains the identical xml escaping (or not) used in the url passed to encodeActionURL. I.e. if the incoming url is xml escaped the the returned url msut also be xml escaped, likewise if the incoming url isn't escaped the returned url must not be escaped. In the case xml escaping can't be determined from the incoming url, the bridge must assume the url is not xml escaped and return an unescaped url accordingly. Also, because there are situations where Faces components will further encode returned url strings by replacing <spaces> in the url with the '+' which not all portlet containers may be able to subsequently process, the bridge can (should) url encode the space character (%20) prior to returning the url regardless of any stipulation regarding base encoding.</p>
<p>Test: Single test for containing encodeActionURL and encodeResourceURL tests. In render, call encodeActionURL 3 times: pased url (1) is xml escaped, (2) isn't xml escaped, (3) contains no indication -- i.e. no query satring. Test that each url returned contains the corresponding encoding/escaping. Do same for encodeResourceUrl (where the url is to another Faces view).</p>

<p>Test: Write test that raises an event in an action, then in the event handler navigates to the results view. Have test's event target contain QS parameter for switching mode but to a mode that doesn't exist (for this portlet). Test in render that we are still in &quot;view&quot; mode.</p>

<p>[<a name="6.108"></a>6.108] (encodeActionURL) recognize the query string parameter <code>javax.portlet.faces.Secure</code> and use the value of this parameter to identify the security level that should be encoded in the generated reference (During event)</p>
<p>Test: Write test that raises an event in an action, then in the event handler navigates to the results view. Have test's event target contain security parameter for changing Security. Test in render that we are in that security state.</p>

<p>[<a name="6.109"></a>6.109] (encodeActionURL) A value of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> is translated into the <code>boolean true/false</code> respectively regardless of case. Any other value is ignored. (During event)</p>

<p>Test: Test uses Trinidad -- have portlet configure the Trinidad renderkit via the portlet.xml entry. Run and action followed by a render. Ensure that in each request the parameter is present in each of the three items above and when a value is present that it has the correct/configured value.</p>
<p>[<a name="6.136"></a>6.136-6.152] If executed during the <code>RENDER_PHASE</code> or <code>RESOURCE_PHASE</code> and the target was determined by its url path (not portlet: syntax) and that target is a nonFaces <code>viewId</code>, construct and return a <code>renderURL</code> ....</p>
<p>Test: Reprise of tests 6.118-6.125 except the target is a nonfaces viewId. To accomplish this we need a bean that generates the test url and sets a flag indicating it has done so/rendered. We also provide our own portlet (subclass) that on render checks for the flag -- if so this is the first render after the rendering of the test url -- so if all things do right its the render of the portlet after the test url has been cliucked/submitted (i.e. spec says this is a renderURL not a portlet actionURL) . Resource tests are the same as the render tests except the testURL is rendered in the jsp that supplies the iFrame target (resource).</p>
