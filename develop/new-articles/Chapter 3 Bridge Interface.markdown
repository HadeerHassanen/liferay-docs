# Introduction [](id=tutorials)

Welcome to Liferay Tutorials! 
These tutorials show you how to build powerful, robust apps using Liferay's
tools, frameworks, and APIs. The tutorials compliment the fundamentals that you
can master in Liferay's
[Learning Paths](/develop/learning-paths/-/knowledge_base/6-2/welcome),
giving you keen insight into the Liferay platform for building top-notch apps,
designing stylish themes, and customizing Liferay Portal to meet your needs. The
tutorials cover the following three main areas: 

- Using Liferay Development Tools
- Developing Liferay Applications
- Styling and Customizing Liferay

First, consider the tools Liferay provides to make your job easier.

#### Using Liferay Development Tools [](id=using-liferay-development-tools)

Since many developers coming to Liferay already have a set of tools they use,
these tutorials assume you're using one of three common environments: 1) An
Ant-based command-line environment that integrates with a wide variety of tools,
2) The easy-to-use Liferay IDE that minimizes your learning curve while giving
you powerful development features, and 3) Maven, a widely adopted project
management system. The Liferay Developer Network provides learning paths and
tutorials that teach you how to use these three environments. 

If you don't like Eclipse (which Liferay IDE is based on) and prefer to use
NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, or something else, you certainly can. Liferay code can
be written in any way Java code is written. 

#### Developing Liferay Applications [](id=developing-liferay-applications)

As a developer wanting to run your own applications on top of Liferay Portal,
you probably want to know *what's the best and quickest way to do it?* Liferay
supports two main, standards-based technologies for incorporating your
applications into Liferay: **Portlets** and **OpenSocial gadgets**. Portlets can
be written using any of the Java web frameworks that support portlet
development, including Liferay's MVC Portlet framework and JavaServer&#8482;
Faces (JSF).

As you write apps, you'll want to leverage powerful frameworks that work
seamlessly with Liferay and help you complete your app faster. Liferay contains
several frameworks that give you all the tools you need to perform various
common tasks that you don't want to have to write yourself, such as handling
permissions and letting users enter comments, categories, and tags. 

<!-- Here
are just a few of the framework topics the tutorials cover in detail.

[Application Display Templates](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/application-display-templates)

In addition to Liferay's frameworks, you'll want to check out the powerful
tag libraries and snazzy UI components that
[AlloyUI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/alloyui) and
[Liferay UI Taglibs](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/liferay-ui-taglibs)
provide.

#### Styling and Customizing Liferay [](id=styling-and-customizing-liferay)

What if you want to skin Liferay or customize it? Creating themes and
customizations is easy in Liferay. 

Now that you know what Liferay Tutorials offers, it's time to discover new
things as you develop sites in Liferay. 

To get you started, here are links to topics in the three areas
discussed on this page.
