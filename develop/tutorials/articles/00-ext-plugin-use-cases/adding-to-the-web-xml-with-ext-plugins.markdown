# Adding to the web.xml with Ext Plugins

A supported use case for using Ext Plugins in Liferay DXP is adding additional
functionality to Liferay Digital Enterprise's `web.xml` file. Before beginning,
make sure you've reviewed the generalized
[Advanced Customization with Ext Plugins](/documentation/7.0/develop/tutorials/-/official_documentation/tutorials/advanced-customization-with-ext-plugins)
tutorial.

As an example, you'll create a sample Ext plugin that adds to your Liferay
Digital Enterprise's existing `web.xml` file (e.g., in the
`/tomcat-[version]/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF` folder). You'll add a new printout in
the console during Liferay Digital Enterprise's startup.

1.  Navigate into your Plugins SDK's `/ext` folder and run the following
    command:

        create.[bat|sh]  add-printout "Add Printout"

    Your Ext plugin is generated and now resides in the Plugins SDK's `/ext`
    folder with the name you assigned followed by `-ext` (e.g.,
    `add-printout-ext`).

2.  For your Liferay Digital Enterprise installation to recognize new
    functionality in the `web.xml`, you must create a class that implements the
    [ServletContextListener](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html)
    interface. This class will initialize a servlet context event for which
    you'll add your new functionality. In the `/docroot/WEB-INF/ext-impl/src`
    folder, create the folder structure representing the package name you want
    your new class to reside in (e.g., `com/liferay/portal/servlet/context`).
    Then create your new Java class:

        package com.liferay.portal.servlet.context;

        import javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;
        import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;

        public class ExtAddEntryWebXmlPortalContextLoaderListener
                implements ServletContextListener {

            public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent servletContextEvent) {
            }

            public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent servletContextEvent) {
                System.out.println("EXT_ADD_ENTRY_WEBXML_INSTALLED_SUCCESSFULLY");
            }

        }

    The above class includes two methods that initialize and destroy your
    servlet context event. Be sure to add the new `web.xml`'s functionality when
    the portal context is initializing. To add a printout verifying the Ext
    plugins installation, a simple print statement was defined in the
    `contextInitialized(...)` method:

        System.out.println("EXT_ADD_ENTRY_WEBXML_INSTALLED_SUCCESSFULLY");

3.  Now that you've defined a servlet context event, you should add a listener
    to your `web.xml` that listens for it. In the
    `docroot/WEB-INF/ext-web/docroot/WEB-INF` folder, open the `web.xml` file,
    which was generated for you by default.

4.  Add the following <listener> tag between the <web-app> tags:

        <listener>
            <listener-class>com.liferay.portal.servlet.context.ExtAddEntryWebXmlPortalContextLoaderListener</listener-class>
        </listener>

Excellent! Now when your Ext plugin is deployed, your Liferay Digital Enterprise
installation will create a `ServletContextListener` instance, which will initialize
a custom servlet context event. This event will be recognized by the `web.xml`
file, which will add the new functionality to your Liferay Digital Enterprise
installation. Follow the instructions in the
[Deploy the Plugin](/documentation/7.0/develop/tutorials/-/official_documentation/tutorials/advanced-customization-with-ext-plugins#deploy-the-plugin)
section for help deploying the Ext plugin to your server.
